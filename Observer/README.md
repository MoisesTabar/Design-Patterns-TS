<h2>Observer Pattern</h2>

<h4>Definition</h4>
<p>
    Observer is a behavior pattern that allows an object to notify other objects about changes in their state.
    Observer allows you to react to other events that take place in other objects without attaching to their classes

<p><b>Note: it is essential to work with abstraction, so our code will be more reusable</b><p>
