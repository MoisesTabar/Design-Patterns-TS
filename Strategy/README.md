<h2>Strategy Pattern</h2>

<h4>Definition</h4>
<p>
    Strategy defines a series of algorithms, encapsulates them and makes them interchangable. 
</p>
<p>
    <b>Note: We can have a very flexible system without using a lot of inheritance when we use strategy. Instead of using inheritance as the main resource of reusing code, we can also use composition. Also we can get rid of a switch statement in programs
    </b>
